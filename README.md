# turtle-race

Sleek, browser-based turtle racing - PyScript + Canvas. Neon visuals, stylized avatars, soft motion trails, and a modern UI.

## Features
- Runs entirely in the browser (PyScript + JS Canvas)
- Adjustable chaos level, laps, and betting
- Sound effects and confetti on win

## Run locally (Windows)
1. Open a terminal in the project folder:
   cd "d:\Python Project\Project1\turtle-race"
2. Start a local HTTP server:
   python -m http.server 8000
3. Open the game in your browser:
   http://localhost:8000/index.html

(Opening the HTML file directly may work, but a local server avoids CORS and asset issues.)
